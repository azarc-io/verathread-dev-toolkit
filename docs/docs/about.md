# About The Developer Toolkit

The Toolkit allows us to have a centrally managed development toolkit that is compatible with any project.

It removes the need to manage common dependencies and scripts in every repository and allows us to manage versions
and bug fixes in one place.

See the roadmap for current and future features.
